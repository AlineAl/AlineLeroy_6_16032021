### Build a secure API for a food review app

This is a project of Openclassrooms. This is about working on an application on the back-end side.

## ðŸ’¾ Step by step

For the first time in the course, I was able to configure the connection to a database to store the data (user information and the characteristics of the sauces). This was an opportunity to make me aware of security on the web, in particular the GDPR standards. I learned how to hash an email and question this practice. I also learned how to encrypt the password before it is saved in the database to protect user data.

I was also able to familiarize myself with a base of the net: the likes! I had a lot of fun trying to figure out how to think about my condition so that the like or the dislike works. I was also able to see all the possibilities offered by Express.

## ðŸ”Œ Points to improve

I should have learned more about safety standards. I did not take the time to understand everything and that is part of my goals.
